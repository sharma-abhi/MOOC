The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

You will find the following files:

1. an R script run_analysis.R that extracts and transforms the data and creates the tidy dataset.
2. a tidy data set, tidy_data.txt, which contains the tidy data.
3. a Code book, CodeBook.md, that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
4. a README.md file which explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
